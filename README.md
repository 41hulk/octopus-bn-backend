## Project setup
---
### Dotenv setup
 1. ***Get some stuffs on table***
  * Run ``` npm install ```
  * Create ``` .env ``` in project root directory
  * Take a look at the ``` .env.example ```  file which is in the project root directory to have a clue on environment variables that are being used in this project
  * Copy all keys from the ``` .env.example ```  file to ``` .env ``` file and add values to corresponding keys. These can be obtained from the project administrator
  * Feel free to add other keys and values according to your feature requirements
  ***Note***: Add keys in ``` .env.example ``` to ease next setup for other developers.

  2. ***Time to serve***
   * For you to use your new environment variable you have to import ``` dotenv ``` module in the file where you want to utilise your environment variables and configure it. like this: ```import dotenv from 'dotenv';
   dotenv.config();```

   * Then you'll be able to access your environment variables via ``` process.env.YOUR_KEY ```
   * That's it, you're good to go!, happy coding!
### Sequelize ORM setup
1. ***Configuring ```.env```***
   * Download and install [pgAdmin](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   * Create two databases, one for testing and another for development.
   * Copy ``` DATABASE_DEV_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_password@127.0.0.1:5432/your_dev_db_name ``` 
          ``` DATABASE_TEST_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_password@127.0.0.1:5432/your_test_db_name```
    from ```.env.example``` to ```.env```
   * Edit it with your database user, password and database name.
